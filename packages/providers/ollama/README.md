# @loomfsm/provider-ollama

Local-model provider for loom: runs agents through a local Ollama server — no API key, no
data leaving your machine. Bind an agent with `loom models set <agent> ollama:<model>`.
Installed on demand — the base `@loomfsm/pipeline` stays lean.

## Part of loom

[loom](https://loomfsm.dev) drives multi-step LLM agent work — code review, implementation,
any review-gated task — as a replay-deterministic state machine: safety invariants enforced
at commit time, human gates where they matter, and a complete, replayable audit trail in a
local SQLite file.

**Most users should install [`@loomfsm/pipeline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loomfsm/pipeline)**
(`npm i -g @loomfsm/pipeline`), which pulls the whole runtime in one step. Install this
package directly only if you are assembling your own runtime.
